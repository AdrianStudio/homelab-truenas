# 02 - TrueNAS SCALE Installation

## Overview

This section covers the installation of TrueNAS SCALE, including creating the bootable USB drive, installing the operating system, and performing the initial system setup.

TrueNAS SCALE is a Linux-based NAS operating system designed for storage management, virtualization, container workloads, and infrastructure services.

It provides:

- Enterprise-grade storage management (ZFS)
- Web-based management interface
- Virtual machine support
- Docker container support
- High reliability and data protection

---

## Requirements

Before starting, you will need:

- USB drive (minimum 8 GB)
- TrueNAS SCALE ISO file
- Desktop or laptop to create the bootable USB
- Target server for installation
- Dedicated SSD for the OS (recommended minimum: 120 GB)

---

## 1. Download TrueNAS SCALE

Go to the official TrueNAS website:

https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-scale/

Download the latest stable version of TrueNAS SCALE.

This will download an `.iso` file, which contains the operating system installer.

---

## 2. Create Bootable USB Drive

To install TrueNAS, you must create a bootable USB installer.

I used Balena Etcher, which is simple and reliable.

Download Balena Etcher:

https://etcher.balena.io/

Install and open Balena Etcher.

You will see three steps:

- Flash from file
- Select target
- Flash

### Step 1: Select ISO file

Click:

Flash from file

Select the TrueNAS SCALE ISO you downloaded.

---

### Step 2: Select USB drive

Click:

Select target

Choose your USB drive.

Make sure you select the correct device, as it will be erased.

---

### Step 3: Flash USB

Click:

Flash

This will:

- Format the USB drive
- Write the TrueNAS installer
- Make it bootable

Wait until the process completes.

## Why use a bootable USB?

A bootable USB allows the system to load the installer before any operating system is installed.

This is required because the target system does not yet have TrueNAS installed.

---

## 3. Boot from USB

Insert the bootable USB into the server.

Power on the system.

Enter the boot menu.

On HP systems, press F9 (for others it might be F12 or F10)

Select the USB device from the boot list.

The TrueNAS installer will load.

---

## 4. Install TrueNAS SCALE

When the installer loads, select:

Install/Upgrade

Press Enter.

You will see a list of available disks.

Select the dedicated OS SSD.

In my case:

Goldenfir SSD 500 GB

Press Space to select.

Press Enter to confirm.

---

## Warning

This will erase the selected disk.

Make sure you select the correct disk.

Do NOT select your storage drives.

---

## 5. Select Boot Mode

Choose:

Boot via UEFI

This is the modern and recommended boot mode.

---

## 6. Create Administrator Password

You will be prompted to create the administrator password.

This password will be used to access the web interface.

Make sure to store it securely.

---

## 7. Complete Installation

The installer will copy the operating system to the disk.

This usually takes 2–5 minutes.

When finished, select:

Reboot System

Remove the USB drive.

The system will now boot from the installed TrueNAS system.

---

## 8. First Boot

After rebooting, TrueNAS will load and display the system console.

You will see the system information and management IP address.

Example:

192.168.1.xxx

This is the IP address used to access the web interface.

---

## 9. Access Web Interface

From another computer on the same network, open a browser and go to:

http://(the ip that appears on the screen)

Login using the administrator credentials created during installation.

This will open the TrueNAS management interface.

From here, all configuration will be performed.
